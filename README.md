### Hello, Adrien here ðŸ‘‹.

I learned programming very young, and am still programming up to this day!

I'm a person who has passion for computer science and software development.

Here I mostly have video game related projects, especially modding tools, as I am curious in understanding how the games work and want to make it possible for me or communities to expand them further, if possible. :)

I do have interest in other domains as well. I have done some small projects in web development, mobile app development robotics, machine learning, embedded, and I'm always interested in learning new things.
